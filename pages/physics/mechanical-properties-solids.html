        <h2>1. Elasticity</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Elasticity refers to the property of
          materials that enables them to return to their original shape and size
          after the external deforming forces are removed.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Elastic vs. Plastic Behavior:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Elastic Behavior:</strong> If a material returns to its
            original shape after the force is removed, it is said to be elastic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plastic Behavior:</strong> If a material does not return to
            its original shape and remains deformed, it exhibits plastic
            behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Rubber exhibits high elasticity, while clay
          shows plasticity after deformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> Elastic materials are crucial in
          designing springs, bridges, and buildings to ensure they can endure
          stress without permanent deformation.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Stress-Strain Relationship</h2>
        <h3>Stress</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Stress is the internal restoring force
          per unit area exerted by a material in response to an applied force.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Stress = Force (F) / Area (A)</p>
        <p><strong>Unit:</strong> Pascal (Pa) or N/m<sup>2</sup></p>
        <h4>Types of Stress:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tensile Stress:</strong> Produced when a material is
            stretched. <br />
            Formula: <code>σ<sub>t</sub> = F/A</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compressive Stress:</strong> Produced when a material is
            compressed. <br />
            Formula: Same as tensile stress, but force is inward.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shear Stress:</strong> Produced when the force applied is
            parallel to the surface. <br />
            Formula: <code>σ<sub>s</sub> = F/A</code>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Strain</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Strain is the ratio of the change in
          dimensions of a material to its original dimensions due to stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula:</strong> Strain = Change in dimension (ΔL) / Original
          dimension (L)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unit:</strong> Dimensionless (no units).</p>
        <h4>Types of Strain:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tensile Strain:</strong> <code>ε<sub>t</sub> = ΔL/L</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Volumetric Strain:</strong>
            <code>ε<sub>v</sub> = ΔV/V</code>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Shear Strain:</strong> <code>γ = Δx/L</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Hooke's Law</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Statement:</strong> Within the elastic limit, the stress
          applied to a material is directly proportional to the strain it
          produces.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> <code>σ = E × ε</code></p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>σ</code> = Stress</li>
          <li><code>ε</code> = Strain</li>
          <li>
            <code>E</code> = Elastic Modulus (specific to the material, e.g.,
            Young’s modulus).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Elastic Limit:</strong> The maximum stress a material can
          withstand without undergoing permanent deformation. Beyond this limit,
          Hooke's law is no longer applicable, and the material behaves
          plastically.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Graph of Stress vs. Strain:</strong> The graph of stress vs.
          strain is linear within the elastic limit. The slope of the graph in
          this region is the elastic modulus of the material.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Beyond the Elastic Limit:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Proportional Limit:</strong> The point at which the
            stress-strain curve deviates from linearity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Yield Point:</strong> The material begins to deform
            plastically.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Fracture Point:</strong> The material breaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Elastic Moduli</h2>
        <p>
          Elastic moduli provide measures of a material's ability to resist
          deformation under applied forces. The three primary moduli are:
        </p>
        <h3>1. Young’s Modulus (Y)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Young’s modulus is the ratio of tensile
          stress to tensile strain and is a measure of the stiffness of a
          material.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula:</strong>
          <code
            >Y = Tensile stress / Tensile strain = F/A / ΔL/L = (F × L) / (A ×
            ΔL)</code
          >
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unit:</strong> Pascal (Pa).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Physical Meaning:</strong> A higher Young’s modulus indicates
          that the material is stiffer, i.e., it deforms less for the same
          applied force.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> Materials with high Young’s modulus are
          used in construction (steel), while materials with low Young’s modulus
          are used in flexible products (rubber).
        </p>

        <h3>2. Bulk Modulus (K)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Bulk modulus is the ratio of volumetric
          stress (change in pressure) to volumetric strain (change in volume).
          It quantifies the material's resistance to uniform compression.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula:</strong>
          <code>K = Volumetric stress / Volumetric strain = P / (ΔV/V)</code>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unit:</strong> Pascal (Pa).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Physical Meaning:</strong> A higher bulk modulus indicates
          that the material is less compressible (e.g., steel), while a lower
          bulk modulus means the material is more compressible (e.g., rubber).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> Bulk modulus is important for studying
          the behavior of fluids and gases under pressure.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Shear Modulus (G) or Modulus of Rigidity</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Shear modulus is the ratio of shear
          stress to shear strain, describing how a material resists shape
          changes when subjected to shear forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula:</strong>
          <code>G = Shear stress / Shear strain = F/A / Δx/L</code>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unit:</strong> Pascal (Pa).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Physical Meaning:</strong> A higher shear modulus means the
          material is more rigid and resists deformation due to shear forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> Relevant in torsion problems, like the
          twisting of a shaft.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Poisson's Ratio (ν)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Poisson's ratio is the ratio of lateral
          strain to longitudinal strain. When a material is stretched or
          compressed in one direction, it tends to contract or expand in
          perpendicular directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula:</strong>
          <code>ν = Lateral strain / Longitudinal strain</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Typical values:</strong> For most materials, Poisson's ratio
          is between 0 and 0.5. <br />
          <code>ν ≈ 0.25</code> for steel. <br />
          <code>ν = 0.5</code> for incompressible materials like rubber.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Physical Meaning:</strong> A higher Poisson’s ratio means the
          material experiences significant lateral expansion or contraction when
          stretched or compressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> Important in the design of structures
          and in understanding material deformation under complex loading
          conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Elastic Energy (Strain Energy)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Elastic energy is the energy stored in a
          material when it is deformed elastically. This energy is released when
          the material returns to its original shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formula for elastic energy:</strong>
          <code>U = 1/2 × Stress × Strain × Volume</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For a stretched wire:</strong>
          <code>U = 1/2 × Y × (ΔL/L)² × A × L</code>
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Y</code> = Young’s modulus</li>
          <li><code>ΔL</code> = Change in length</li>
          <li><code>A</code> = Area of cross-section</li>
          <li><code>L</code> = Original length.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Physical Meaning:</strong> The energy is stored as potential
          energy due to the deformation, and it can be recovered when the force
          is removed. It is crucial for problems involving energy conservation
          and springs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Elastic energy is stored in a compressed
          spring, and this energy is released when the spring returns to its
          original length.
